Nice to meet you! I'm currently working at GitHub as a software engineer.
I recently graduated from the [Shopify Dev Degree](https://devdegree.ca/) program in Spring 2022.
I've previously worked on building the [Shopify Fulfillment Network](https://www.shopify.com/fulfillment) as a fullstack developer, Shopify's Experimentation Platform as a data developer, Shopify Checkout as a backend developer, and Shopify's Caching Platform as a production engineer.
